# marching-cubes-mesh-slicing
This is a test-ground project using marching cubes algorithm for freeform mesh slicing. 
On top of that it uses signed distance functions to determine an object surface to generate
and connected components labeling algorithm to split sliced mesh parts from the original surface.
Much of computations made with compute shaders.
